Hi, I’m @Parteg132. I’m interested in Computer Science, especially programming. I’m currently studying Cybersecurity at the Wrocław University of Science and Technology. 
Right now I’m polishing my skills in python and I have a bit of knowledge in C++, but I want to learn a lot more. The best way to reach me is to send an email
to parteg7@gmail.com or to write a message on linkedin linkedin.com/in/bartosz-maślicki-4833b220b.
